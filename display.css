/*Most fundamental types of display are: inline, block and none.
They can be manipulated with the display property and the values inline, block
and none wow surprise.*/

/*Inline does just what it says, stuff is displayed in the flow of
a line. */

li { display: inline }

/*For example, this would make all list items in a list to appear 
next to each other rather than on top of each other. */

/*Block makes a box standalone, fitting the entire width of
its containing box, with an effective line break before and after it.
Allows greater manipulation of height, margins and padding. Heading and paragraph
elements are examples of elements that are displayed like this by default
in browsers.*/

/*This would make all links in nav large clickable blocks.*/
#navigation a {
  display: block;
  padding: 20px 10px;
}

/*None
  doesn't display a box at all, used with dynamic effects? */

  #navigation, #related_links { display: none }

/*Tables It differs from normal table tag in HTML in that here you
can construct tables by columns, as opposed to the row based method
used in HTML. Apparently, we should still use HTML.*/
